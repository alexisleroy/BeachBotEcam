// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This example code was used to successfully communicate with 15 ultrasonic sensors. You can adjust
// the number of sensors in your project by changing SONAR_NUM and the number of NewPing objects in the
// "sonar" array. You also need to change the pins for each sensor for the NewPing objects. Each sensor
// is pinged at 33ms intervals. So, one cycle of all sensors takes 495ms (33 * 15 = 495ms). The results
// are sent to the "oneSensorCycle" function which currently just displays the distance data. Your project
// would normally process the sensor results in this function (for example, decide if a robot needs to
// turn and call the turn function). Keep in mind this example is event-driven. Your complete sketch needs
// to be written so there's no "delay" commands and the loop() cycles at faster than a 33ms rate. If other
// processes take longer than 33ms, you'll need to increase PING_INTERVAL so it doesn't get behind.
